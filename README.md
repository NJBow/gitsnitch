## GitSnitch

This is a tool to search user's GitHub repos for carelessly pushed Facebook secret keys.

It is a single page web app built with Ruby on Rails. It uses GitHub search API and a regular expression filter to check whether a user has Facebook secrets in their repos.

Currently the feature only finds facebook app_secrets but can be editted to search for any secets, IDs, mobile number or even Credit card details.
