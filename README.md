# GitSnitch

This is a tool to search user's GitHub repos for carelessly pushed Facebook secret keys.

It is a single page web app build with Ruby on Rails in four days by four Makers Academy students. It uses GitHub search API and a regular expression filter to check whether a user has Facebook secrets in their repos.
